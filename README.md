Ensured you have SSH access to Tiger GitHub.

Created a private repository named mle-training with an empty README.

Created a GitHub issue for the current assignment and add in the details based on what is requested in this assignment and assign it to yourself. Note the issue-id. 

Created a new branch (enh/<issue-id>/<short-msg>) and copy the code-snippet here and commit as-is including the README. Use appropriate commit messages as per the guidelines.

Added a .gitignore file to the repository to avoid committing unnecessary files like pyc files and the CSV data files in your current folder.  

Used Conda to set up a python development environment named mle-dev to run the script. Exported the environments file as env.yml and commit it to the repository.

Updated the README file with instructions on how to run the code.

Created a Pull Request.
